# Numerical-Methods

1. Euler and bisection method - looking for a zero position in an interval 
2. Jacobi method - solving systems of equations
3. Lagrange interpolation - Lagrange interpolation at the Chebyshev points
4. Numerical integration - numerical integration: complex Newton-Cotes quadrature based on three nodes (Simpson formula) and integration on the interval [0, + ∞) with weight e − x (Laguerre polynomials) of the integrals of the form ∫ + ∞0e − xf (x) dx
